.Dt asl.conf 5
.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME
.Nm asl.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr syslogd 8
asl_action module.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr syslogd 8
server in Mac OS X includes a module that compares messages with a set of query patterns,
and which performs various actions when messages match the query patterns.
.Pp
Each line in the file contains three components.
The first is a query, the second is an action, and the third contains parameters specific to that action.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl Q [= Sender foobar] [N< Level 3] notify com.apple.foobar
.Pp
.Ss Queries
Queries start with the letter "Q" followed by whitespace.
Following that are any number of message matching components, each of which has the form:
.Pp
.Dl [OP KEY VAL]
.Pp
OP is a comparison operator.
It can have the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "<=  " -compact -offset indent
.It T
true (always matches)
.It =
equal
.It !
not equal
.It >
greater than
.It >=
greater than or equal to
.It <
less than
.It <=
less than or equal to
.El
.Pp
It can also be preceded by one or more modifiers:
.Bl -tag -width "C   " -compact -offset indent
.Pp
.It C
casefold
.It N
numeric comparison
.It S
substring
.It A
prefix
.It Z
suffix
.El
.Pp
KEY and VAL are message keys and values.
For example
.Pp
.Dl Q [= Sender foobar]
.Pp
matches any message with key="Sender" and val="foobar".
The query
.Pp
.Dl Q [CA= Color gr]
.Pp
matches any message with key=Color and val beginning with the letters GR, Gr, gr, or gR
(C meaning casefold, A meaning prefix).
The example query above,
.Pp
.Dl Q [= Sender foobar] [N< Level 3]
.Pp
matches any message from "foobar" with a level numerically less than 3
(string values are converted to integers, and the comparison is done on the integer values).
.Pp
The "T" operator is useful to test for the presence of a particular key.
.Pp
.Dl Q [T Flavor whatever]
.Pp
Will match any message that has a "Flavor" key, regardless of its value.
.Pp
.Ss Actions
The "notify" action causes
.Nm syslogd
to post a notification with
.Fn notify_post .
The notification key must appear as a single parameter following the "notify" action.
.Pp
The "access" action sets read access controls for messages that match the associated query pattern. 
.Nm syslogd
will restrict read access to matching messages to a specific user and group.
The user ID number and group ID number must follow the "access" keyword as parameters.
.Pp
The "store" action saves matching messages in a separate log message database.
The database may be accessed using the
.Nm syslog
command line utility.
A database pathname must follow the "store" keyword. 
A new database will be created if one does not exist.
Two optional parameters, "stayopen" and "exclude_asldb" may follow the database pathname.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm syslogd
will open the database, save a matching message, and then close the database.
If a high volume of messages is expected, specifying "stayopen" will improve performance.
.Pp
Specifying "exclude_asldb" will cause syslogd to save matching messages in the database,
but exclude them from the main 
.Nm syslogd
database (/var/log/asl.db).
